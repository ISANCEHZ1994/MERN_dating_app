import React from 'react';

export default class HomePage extends React.Component{

    state = { 

    }

    render(){
        return(
            <div>
                <NavBar/>

                This is what I want the user to see whenever they are  <br></br>
                Here I want to make people sign up OR create an account
            </div>
        )
    }

};
